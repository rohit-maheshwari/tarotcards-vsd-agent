    "Undesired_Consequence": "The deployment of the smart sensing devices resulted in a heavy dispute in the researchers' deparment. The main undesired consequences were that: \n(a) the devices collected audio data, including private conversations in the entire building.  \n(b) faculty members and students who used that building felt that they had not consented to their data being collected and perceived a lack of autonomy over these decisions.\n(c) increased fears around surveillance in the workplace, constant data collection and other privacy risks. \n\nWhile these sensors where only tested and deployed on a university campus, but what if they were commercialized and used in the real world? The existance of these sensors at a large scale raises issues around privacy, anonymity, and consent.",
